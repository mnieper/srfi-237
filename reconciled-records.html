    <h2 id="status">Status</h2>

    <p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
      to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
      The editor will add this section.</p>

    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This SRFI defines a version of
      the <code>define-record-type</code> definition
      of <code>R<sup>6</sup>RS</code> that extends
      the <code>define-record-type</code> syntax
      of <code>R<sup>7</sup>RS</code>, reconciling both systems.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <p>None at present.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>In contrast to R<sup>6</sup>RS, the Scheme standard
      R<sup>7</sup>RS does not yet have record types that can be
      extended via single inheritence, can be defined procedurally, or
      can be inspected.  Several proposals, including SRFI 99, SRFI
      131, SRFI 136, and SRFI 150, have been made to add such record
      types to R<sup>7</sup>RS.  Each of these proposals, however, is
      lacking in at least one of the following areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed syntax and/or semantics are new and untested in
          the large.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed semantics is not compatible with
          R<sup>7</sup>RS field names interpreted as (hygienic)
          identifiers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed semantics are not reconciled with
          R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This SRFI therefore proposes to adopt the established and
      widely used R<sup>6</sup>RS record system for R<sup>7</sup>RS.
      For this, the <code>define-record-type</code> form of R<sup>7</sup>RS is extended (see below).</p>

    <p>The advantages of this proposal include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>R<sup>7</sup>RS gets a record-type facility as powerful
          as the R<sup>6</sup>RS record-type facility including
          single-inheritance, a procedural interface, and
          inspection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Porting code and sharing specifications between R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS becomes simplified.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Scheme systems supporting both R<sup>6</sup>RS and
          R<sup>7</sup>RS need only one implementation of record types.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In principle, the proposal works with the SRFI 9 record
          field names interpreted as identifiers or as symbols.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The record-type facility is known and tested in the large.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Note:</i> Objections against the R<sup>6</sup>RS record
      system were were voiced by people voting against ratification of
      that standard's latest candidate draft.  These objections
      touched the complexity, the role of the procedural layer, and
      the compatibility between the syntactic and the procedural layer
      of the R<sup>6</sup>RS record system.  These objections can be addressed as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>While the complexity of the record system would have
          exceeded the scope and size of R<sup>7</sup>RS-small, it
          fits the scope and size of R<sup>7</sup>RS-large.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The procedural layer is intended to be used when record
          types have to be constructed at runtime, e.g. by
          interpreters that need to construct host-compatible record
          types.  The procedural layer much like the inspection layer
          is therefore not needed for most code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The syntactic and the procedural layer are compatible and a
          syntactically defined record type can inherit from a
          procedurally defined record type, and vice versa.  Whether a
          record type has been defined syntactically or procedurally
          is generally unobservable.  To inherit from a record type
          all that has to be exposed from it is either the (bound)
          record name or the record type descriptor (with or without a
          record constructor descriptor).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>The syntax described in this section is provided by
      the <code>(srfi ###)</code> library on R<sup>7</sup>RS systems,
      and the <code>(srfi :###)</code> and <code>(srfi :###
        define-record-type)</code> libraries on R<sup>6</sup>RS systems.</p>

    <p>The libraries also export the auxiliary
      syntax <code>fields</code>, <code>mutable</code>, <code>immutable</code>, <code>parent</code>, <code>protocol</code>, <code>sealed</code>, <code>opaque</code>, <code>nongenerative</code>, <code>parent-rtd</code>.</p>

    <p>An R<sup>7</sup>RS system may provide
      the <code>define-record-type</code> syntax also by <code>(scheme
      base)</code>.</p>

    <p><code>(define-record-type &lang;name spec&rang; &lang;record clause&rang; &hellip;)</code></p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i> This syntax is identical to the syntax of the
      record-type-defining form <code>define-record-type</code>
      exported by <code>(rnrs records syntactic (6))</code>.</p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i>
      This definition is equivalent to the record-type-defining
      form <code>define-record-type</code> exported by <code>(rnrs
        records syntactic (6))</code>.</p>

    <p><code>(define-record-type &lang;name&rang;
        (&lang;constructor name&rang; &lang;field name&rang; &hellip;)
        &lang;pred&rang; &lang;field&rang; &hellip;)</code></p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i>
      <code>&lang;Name&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;constructor
      name&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;pred&rang;</code> are
      identifiers, each <code>&lang;field&rang;</code> is of the
      form <code>(&lang;field name&rang; &lang;accessor
      name&rang;)</code> or <code>(&lang;field name&rang;
      &lang;accessor name&rang; &lang;mutator name&rang;)</code>, and
      all <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;accessor
      names&rang;</code> and <code>&lang;mutator names&rang;</code>
      are identifiers.</p>

    <p>It is an error for the same identifier to occur more than once
      as a field name.</p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i> A new non sealed, non opaque and generative
      base record type is generated, and the form expands into a set
      of definitions in the environment
      where <code>define-record-type</code> appears.</p>

    <p>The record type has as many fields as there
      are <code>&lang;fields&rang;</code>, with the
      given <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code>, in that order.
      Each <code>&lang;field&rang;</code> if of the first form defines
      an immutable field, and an immutable <code>&lang;field&rang;</code> otherwise.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Name&rang;</code> is defined by this definition to
      the (bound) record name of the record type.  If this record
      name is used in the <code>parent</code> clause of
      another <code>define-record-type</code> definition, it is an
      error if that <code>define-record-type</code> definition specifies no <code>protocol</code> clause.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Constructor name&rang;</code> is defined to a
      constructor for the defined record type, taking as many
      arguments as there are <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code>
      listed with <code>&lang;constructor name&rang;</code>.  Fields
      whose names are listed with <code>&lang;constructor
      name&rang;</code> have the corresponding argument as their
      initial value.  The initial values of all other fields are
      unspecified.  It is an error for a field name to be listed with <code>&lang;constructor name&rang;</code>
      but not as a field name of a field.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Predicate&rang;</code> is defined to a predicate
    for the defined record type.</p>

    <p>The <code>&lang;accessor names&rang;</code>
      and <code>&lang;mutator names&rang;</code> are defined to the
      accessors and mutators, respectively, of the corresponding
      fields.</p>

    <p>The Larceny Scheme implementation pioneered the idea of
